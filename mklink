As stated here,

Creation of symbolic links requires the SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege (“Create symbolic links”), which is granted only to administrators by default (but you can change that using security policy).

To change the policies:

Right click on Start→Run and launch secpol.msc.

Open Security Settings → Local Policies → User Rights Assignment and select Create symbolic links (that represents SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege).

Double-click on the item and add yourself (or the whole Users group) to the list.
